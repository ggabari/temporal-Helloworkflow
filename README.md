## Deploying a Golang Application with a Temporal CLuster for data persistency
Prequisites:
<ul>
<li>An EC2 Instance</li>
<li>Install git</li>
<li>Install golang</li>
<li>Install docker</li>
<li>Install docker-compose</li>

Thereafter clone this repository.

To begin, we set up the temporal server using docker-compose which can be found by navigating to the docker folder.
<li>while in the folder, run "docker-compose up", after all the dependencies have been set up, and image has been created</li>
Access the EC2 IP address on port 8080 and the result should look like the image below.
